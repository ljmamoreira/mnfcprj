\chapter{Introduction and first steps}
This document is the stage for a small \LaTeX{} collaborative practice
experiment with \texttt{git}.

To start it, I created a new directory (aka folder) named \texttt{mnfcprj} and
issued the command \texttt{git init} at a terminal opened at that dir. This
command created my local version of the \gls{repo}.

Then, I created the \LaTeX{} main file (\texttt{/mnfcprj.tex}), a different
directory to populate with different chapter files to be
\texttt{\textbackslash{}include}'d and started with the first chapter file
(\texttt{intro.tex}).

Also, I thought that it might be usefull to add a glossary to the document; for
that I created a file to store the glossary definitions (\texttt{glossary.def})
at the root dir. 

Finally, I created the \texttt{.gitignore} file (the initial dot makes it hidden
in unix systems), listing the files generated by the \LaTeX{} (\texttt{.aux},
etc) that we don't to keep under revision control.

The command \texttt{git status} generates the following report:

\noindent
\begin{minipage}{0.96\textwidth}
\begin{verbatim}
ljma:mnfcprj$ git status
On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	.gitignore
	chpts/
	glossary.def
	mnfcprj.tex

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
\end{verbatim}
\end{minipage}
